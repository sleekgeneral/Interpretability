# Reconfigurable Convolutional Coalesced Tsetlin Machine

This repository contains the FPGA implementation of a Reconfigurable Convolutional Coalesced Tsetlin Machine as presented in our paper. The system supports MNIST, FMNIST, KMNIST datasets, and custom dataset testing.

## Specifications

- Maximum number of Clauses :	140 (Reconfigurable)

- Number of Classes	: 10 (Reconfigurable - max = 15)

- Patch Sizes :	3 / 5 / 7 (Reconfigurable)

- Stride : 1 - Patch Size  (Reconfigurable)

- FPGA :ZYNQ ZCU102

- Hierarchy : class_top -> buffer,(uart_rx(remamp unit)-> addr_gen, gen_en),top -> weight_adder, conv_arch -> conv_enable_generation, convolution  

- Ethernet Cable

Note: Weights/clauses are limited to stride = 1. For other strides, get the trained clauses from the TMU library once the stride training update is complete.

Note: The image dimensions have been hard-coded due to hardware constraints. However, if sufficient resources are available, these parameters can be made configurable inputs.

## Getting Started
### Required Tools

Xilinx Vitis 2024.1 or later version
 (Platform + Application projects)

Xilinx Vivado 2024.1 or a later version is required for editing or reusing the code.

MATLAB (for preprocessing)

Python (for host code execution)

## Testing Preprocessed Datasets

Preprocessed datasets (10k images each) are included for:

1. MNIST

2. FMNIST

3. KMNIST

**Steps:**

- Open the Vitis platform and application projects.

- Build both platform and application project.

- Run the application and open the serial monitor at 115200 baud.

- Run the Python host code when the serial monitor displays:Waiting for 10k images

- The Python script sends images into DDR memory for testing.

## Custom images Testing

Preprocess images using:

img_to_hex.m

image_padded.m

Send preprocessed images via python.py to the FPGA.

## Custom Clauses and Weights

Obtain clauses and weights from the TMU library.

Preprocess clauses using clause_formatting.m.

Send clauses to python.py to generate .h files.

Preprocess weights using weights_generator and send the resulting 3 files to python.py.

Include generated .h files in the Vitis workspace.

Implement custom BRAM and weights access code in main.c.

Reference implementations for other datasets are provided in main.c.

## Additional Resources

A video tutorial is attached demonstrating the complete testing and deployment process.

To execute the design, the Vitis-side source code is provided in the SW folder. Alternatively, the complete workspace can be accessed through the following link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/169Ruq36pJO8Rfa5NuXUSX3CmmTXkMXMj?usp=sharing
